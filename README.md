## My process

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

### What I learned

In this project, I had to think about how to apply my JavaScript knowledge to solve a problem. Even though this is a very basic functionality that we come across every day, I realized how these basic functionalities require critical thinking behind the scenes.

After watching the tutorial and trying to write the code from memory, I stumbled upon an alternative solution, so I decided to keep it. I also copied Wes Bos's solution and commented it out in the script.js file. 

### Continued development

I aim to solve most of the other challenges by Wes Bos in this program as they show how JavaScript is used in real world to add common functionalities.
